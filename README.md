# Cpp-Style-Checker

A super-simple script with `clang-format` configuration to match
[S&T's C++ coding standard](http://web.mst.edu/~cpp/cpp_coding_standard_v1_1.pdf). It
should help identify code that does not follow the standard style.

## Note

This may not be totally comprehensive. Don't come crying to me if it
didn't catch all your style problems, or if it suggested changing
style in a way that goes against the S&T C++ coding standard.

It's just a helper script. It's not a genius.

## Dependencies

You'll need to have a couple of things installed for this script to
work:

* `clang-format-3.6`

OK, make that one thing.
