# Cpp-Style-Checker

A super-simple script and `clang-format` configuration to match
[S&T's C++ coding standard](http://web.mst.edu/~cpp/cpp_coding_standard_v1_1.pdf).

## Dependencies

You'll need to have a couple of things installed for this script to
work:

* `clang-format-3.6`

OK, make that one thing.
